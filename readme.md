## Installation
### config

This requires some hard coding in the .env and config_ws08.json file.
If you are contributing I will send a config_ws08.json for you to use with the keys to the various api's.

#### .env
```
CONFIG_PATH="/Users/nick/Documents/_config_files"
CONFIG_FILE_NAME="config_ws08_20221222.json"
CONFIG_TYPE='local'
```
- CONFIG_PATH: enter path to the config file I will send on your local computer
- CONFIG_FILE_NAME: probably config_ws08.json - or whatever you want to call it.
- CONFIG_TYPE: local for your machine. other options are 'dev' and 'prod'.

#### config_ws08.json



### models
Nothing for you to do here
